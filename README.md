# SDR Receiver Project

**Introduction** | This project was created in the scope of the the class ENGR 357 "Engineering Electronics II" conducted through online learning at Walla Walla University. We (Jordyn Watkins and Joshua Silver) were tasked with designing, building, and testing a *software defined radio (SDR) receiver*. For more information on the theory and circuit analysis of the design, please refer to the "Wiki" tab.

**Navigation** | This repository consists of several folders. In this "code" tab, you will find 2 main folders: Attenuator and Receiver. Within the attenuator file, you will find a folder containing the KiCad files, a folder containing the LTspice simulation files, and a                third folder containing build and test notes with pictures and other documentation. The Receiver folder contains 4 main folders: KiCad, LTSpice, Quisk, and Documentation. 

**Results** | The radio is in working condition - producing low noise I and Q signals 90 degrees out of phase. The signal discernability is very good, and the image rejection should also be decent (although we were unable to test the image rejection due to software issues with quisk only using 1 channel instead of 2). For more details on the specs for the radio, visit the "Wiki" tab under page "Performance".

**Credits** | This project was created with a lot of help from our professor, Dr. Frohne. The files under the Quisk folder are primarily his. See his github profile at https://github.com/frohro/ 

**Status of Project** | Visit the "issues" tab to see errors and fixes for this project - which should provide a more in depth explanation for the quote "status" of the project. Can also visit the "Wiki" page or view the documentation files in the folders for a description of build and test process when troubleshooting issues.
